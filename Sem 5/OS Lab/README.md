## File Naming and Format

* **File Name**: Your submission file must follow this exact format: `<Group No>_<Two Digit Team Number><Assignment Number>.<extn>`.
    * **Examples**: `A2_07_2.c`, `A1_11_7.py`.
* **File Type**: Submissions must be a plain ASCII text file.
* **Forbidden Files**: Do not upload `.zip`, `.docx`, or `.pdf` files.

## Code Documentation

* **Header Comment**: Every file must begin with a block comment containing your name, roll number, and assignment details.
* **I/O Description**: The header must also describe the required input and the generated output.
* **Build & Run Commands**: Include the exact compilation and execution commands in the header comment. Your code must compile without any warnings.
* **General Comments**: Write clean code and use comments where necessary to explain it.

## Coding Style and Practices

* **Indentation**: Always use an indentation of 4 spaces.
* **Code Spacing**: Separate logical blocks of code with a blank newline for readability.
* **Input Handling**: Use command-line arguments to get input for your program. You must not use `scanf`.
* **Error Checking**: Always use the `perror()` function to check the return status of any system or library call.
* **Documentation**: Use the `man` command to look up descriptions for any system or library calls you use.

## Grading and Policies

* **Academic Integrity**: Duplicate assignments will be penalized. Any marks will be divided proportionally among the groups involved.
