## Familiarity with User and System level OS Commands

### Run the commands and validate the output
1) who:-It displays the information about all the users who have logged into the system currently
2) whoami:- It displays Current username, Terminal number, date and time at which user logged into the system
3) pwd:- It displays current working directory
4) date:- It displays system date and time
5) ls - It lists the files and directories stored in the current directory. To list the files in a directory use the following 
syntax: $ls dirname
6) mkdir – It is used to create directories by using the command: $mkdir dirname
7) clear- It clears the screen
8) cd - It is used to change the current working directory to any other directory specified
9) df - It displays currently mounted file systems.
10) rmdir - Directories can be deleted using the rmdir command - $rmdir dirname
11) cat – It displays the contents of a file - $cat filename
12) cp - It is used to copy a file - $ cp source_file destination_file
13) mv- It is used to change the name of a file - $ mv old_file new_file
14) rm – It is used to delete an existing file - $ rm filename
15) stat- It is used to display file or file system status - $ stat filename
16) ln - It is used to create links between files and directories.
17) tty – It prints the filename of the terminal connected to standard input.
18) uname –It prints system information
19) umask – It specifies user file creation mask, implying which of the 3 permissions are to be denied to the owner,group and others.
20) find – It searches for files in a directory hierarchy
21) sort – It sorts the lines of text files
22) ps - It displays information about the current processes.
23) chmod 777 file1 - gives full permission to owner, group and others
24) grep - It finds specific patterns in files.
25) touch - It creates an empty file or updates the timestamp of an existing file.
26) more/less - It displays file content one screen at a time, allowing you to scroll.
27) head/tail - It displays First/Last 10 lines of a File.
28) top - It dynamically displays real-time information about system statistics.
29) kill - It terminates a Process.
30) history - It displays a list of previously executed commands.
31) du - It estimates file space usage (of a file or directory).
32) ping - It tests network connectivity to a host.
33) wc - It counts lines, words, and characters in a file.
34) \>/\>> - It redirects the standard output of a command to a file, overwriting the file if it exists.
35) | - It takes the standard output of one command and uses it as the standard input for another
command.

## Program to get and set environment variables using system calls
### Problem Definition
Program to GET and SET the Environment variable and to know the use of getenv and setenv
system calls
UNIX ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Variables are a way of passing information from the shell to programs when you run them.
Programs look "in the environment" for particular variables and if they are found will use the
values stored. Some are set by the system, others by you, yet others by the shell, or any program
that loads another program. Standard UNIX variables are split into two categories, environment
variables and shell variables. In broad terms, shell variables apply only to the current instance of
the shell and are used to set short-term working conditions; environment variables have a farther
reaching significance, and those set at login are valid for the duration of the session. By
convention, environment variables have UPPER CASE and shell variables have lower case
names.
Display the following environment variables using getenv call:
∙ USER (your login name)
∙ HOME (the path name of your home directory)
∙ HOST (the name of the computer you are using)
∙ ARCH (the architecture of the computer's processor)
∙ DISPLAY (the name of the computer screen to display X windows)
∙ PRINTER (the default printer to send print jobs)
∙ PATH (the directories the shell should search to find a command)
Syntax: Char *getenv( const char *name);
The getenv() function searches the environment list to find the Environment variable name,
and returns a pointer to the corresponding value string.
Now, Set two new environment variables and display them.
Syntax: int setenv(const char * envname,const char * enval,int overwrite)
The setenv() function adds the variable name to the environment with the value value, if name
does not already exist. If name does exist in the environment, then its value is changed to value
if overwrite is nonzero; if overwrite is zero, then the value of name is not changed (and
setenv() returns a success status).
Note: make sure you don't modify the already generated system’s environment variable like
HOME, HOST etc.
